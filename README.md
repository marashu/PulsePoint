PulsePoint
==========

My submission for Global Game Jam 2013.  For this event, we had to create a game in 48 hours fitting the theme "heartbeat" which was revealed to us at the event.  The goal of the game is to have the white blood cell on the glowing pulse point on each beat of the heart.  Every 5 heartbeats a new virus spawns, which you must avoid.  All the details of the game are timed off the user's heartrate, which is calculated at the beginning of the game.

This shows how I code with tight deadlines.  It has not been modified since the event.  The source for the entire project, including the .fla file, can be found at http://globalgamejam.org/2013/pulse-point .  For collision, I used code from freeactionscript.com
